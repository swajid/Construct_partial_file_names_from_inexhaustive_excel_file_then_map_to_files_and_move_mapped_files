# Construct_partial_file_names_from_inexhaustive_excel_file_then_map_to_files_and_move_mapped_files

* Very, very quick script to generate a partial file name, find the file**s** that match the generated partial file name, move them to a unique folder as described in a excel file
* It is always better and safer to copy instead of move
